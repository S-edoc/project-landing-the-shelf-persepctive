          Aidan, a reluctant young boy, is thrust upon an adventure after
          happening upon ancient scrolls leading to a hidden world-- A world
          filled with fantastical creatures, knights, warriors, and kings. Now
          caught between warring kingdoms and the fate of two worlds resting on
          its resolution, Aiden joins an unlikely group of characters on a
          perilous expedition for the salvation of all that is good.

          three books set in the fantastical world of The Realm. Complete with

          adventure involving the age-old battle between good and evil.
